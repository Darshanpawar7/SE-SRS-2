## 1. Introduction

**Purpose:** This document defines the Software Test Plan (STP) for SprintFlow v1.0, an Agile Project Management System. It establishes the objectives, scope, strategy, resources, schedule, and responsibilities for all testing activities, ensuring that the delivered system satisfies the functional and non-functional requirements specified in the Software Requirements Specification (SRS v1.0).

**Scope:** Testing covers all SprintFlow application features including user authentication, Kanban board workflow, task management, sprint lifecycle, Fibonacci estimation, executive dashboard, burndown chart visualization, Supabase cloud database synchronization, offline LocalStorage persistence, and the CI/CD pipeline. Excluded from testing scope: Supabase internal infrastructure, browser rendering engine internals, third-party CDN operations, and operating system-level behaviors.

## 11. Assumptions and Dependencies

**Assumptions:**
- Node.js 18+ and npm 9+ are available on all testing machines
- Supabase cloud sandbox will be accessible for cloud integration testing
- Seed data in mockData.js provides sufficient coverage for functional testing
- Browser DevTools are available for network simulation and performance profiling
- GitHub Actions runners are available for CI/CD pipeline execution
- All team members have Git and GitHub access for branch-based test artifact management

**Dependencies:**
- SRS v1.0 document must be finalized before test case design (satisfied)
- SAD v1.0 document must be finalized before integration test design (satisfied)
- Application codebase must compile and pass unit tests before system testing
- Supabase project must be provisioned for cloud database integration testing
- GitHub repository must be configured with CI/CD workflow for automated test execution

---

## 12. Suspension and Resumption Criteria

**Suspend testing if:**
- Production build fails (npm run build returns non-zero exit code)
- More than 30% of unit tests fail, indicating systemic instability
- Test environment is unavailable for more than 4 hours
- A critical defect is discovered that blocks further test execution
- Supabase cloud service experiences a documented outage affecting all regions

**Resume testing when:**
- Build failures are resolved and verified by a clean npm run build
- Blocking defects are fixed, verified, and the fix is merged to the test branch
- Test environment is restored and validated
- Supabase service status returns to operational
